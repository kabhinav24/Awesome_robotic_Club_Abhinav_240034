I selected this project because it combines my interest in both engineering and chess in an innovative.
The concept of creating a robot that is able to physically play chess integrates mechanical design, electronics, and programming.
I particularly enjoy the challenge of combining sensors, actuators, and decision-making algorithms, and I think this project will be an excellent opportunity to put into practice.
